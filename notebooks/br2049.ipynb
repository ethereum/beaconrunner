Most of the content here remains applicable.\n",

    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We improve upon our first [_Beacon Runner_](br.html), an economics-focused simulation environment for eth2.\n",
    "- We introduce network-level events and simulate a partition. Stake from inactive validators is leaked until active validators dominate on their side of the partition, so finalisation can resume.\n",
    "- We make a short detour to introduce aggregation of attestations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we extend the [_Beacon Runner_](br.html) to create network-level events. This is a second step towards an abstracted (but realistic) simulation environment to study economic properties of validation of eth2. We will make use of our p2p network abstraction to simulate a network partition, where for some reason (an adversary, [a Georgian granny](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access), World War III) the network is split in two with both sides unable to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap' what happened in our [first notebook](br.html), we wrapped the [current eth2 specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md) in a [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD) environment. This wrap augmented the dynamics of chain updates (forming and adding a new block) with validator _policies_, which inform the state updates. We assumed zero network latency, i.e., all validators aware of all events as they happen, and sharing the same view of the chain. In practice, this assumption does not hold. We usually assume a _partially synchronous_ model, where all validators are _eventually_ informed of any event, with no bound on how long this may take (but a finite time in any case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a partially synchronous model, validators may not share the same view of the chain, since they may not be aware that a new block was created when they have not yet received it from the underlying p2p network. In the worst-case, an adversary manipulating the network can successfully game the view of other validators. If they are skilled enough, they could even [pretend that their manipulation is not malicious and is the result of unfortunate network delays](https://ethresear.ch/t/non-attributable-censorship-attack-on-fraud-proof-based-layer2-protocols/6492). How can we create policies that are _robust_ to network uncertainty and strategic interactions?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop these questions throughout, getting insight from our models and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to load the beacon chain specs, as defined by the [canonical eth2 repo](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md). This time, we're using the new `eth2spec` Python package that you can pull directly with `pip` or `pipenv`. We've also built our own version of the specs using the procedure detailed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/tree/dev/tests/core/pyspec#dev-install). It's so simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with the specs constants, like the number of slots per epoch or the base reward factors is also much easier now. We define two different config files, `fast.yaml` and `medium.yaml`. `fast` has a value of `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` set to 4. We don't have time to waste! `medium` sets it to 16 and changes a few other things -- we'll tell you more about it when we get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we import our own custom-built `specs`, prepare the `fast` config file and reload the specs to apply this configuration."

    "Our simulation has one _state variable_, declared in `initial_conditions`, our `network` object. We run the simulation for 300 steps (= 300 slots). Each step can be broken down in the following substeps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Policy):** Validators at state $\\omega[s]$ produce attestations for slot $s-1$.\n",
    "2. **(State update):** Attestations are sent \"over-the-wire\" and propagate in the network.\n",
    "3. **(Policy):** Validators who are designated to produce a block for slot $s$ collect attestations they have heard about and build the block.\n",
    "4. **(State update):** The produced blocks are disseminated and the state is moved to $\\omega[s+1]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, a validator from partition 0 is designated to produce a block for the beacon chain growing in partition 1. In this case no block will be produced in partition 1, since the proposer is either unaware that they were chosen to produce a block or unable to communicate that block to other validators in partition 1.\n",
    "- Under our model, we assume perfect information except for the partition, i.e., all validators in one partition are always in sync (no latency within partitions). This allows us to optimise by purging the attestations included in blocks from the `network.items` list. If we did not have perfect latency, we would want to keep these attestations around, so that the validator whose turn it is to produce a block in a partition, and who may be unaware of all the blocks created in that same partition, can include attestations that, from their perspective, have not yet been included.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the background, we have also optimised the storage of attestations with _aggregates_. If the chain works as expected, validators certainly won't get too creative with what they are attesting, and we should expect a whole lot of attestations to look like each other. Why bother keeping track of a thousand times the same object? Aggregates allow us to securely batch these attestations.\n",

    "### Aggregates\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember how we built attestations in the [initial Beacon Runner](br.html), we had an `aggregation_bits` attribute in `Attestation` instances. In the previous notebook, we set all bits of the `aggregation_bits` to 0, except for the one bit corresponding to the validator's index in its committee, which we set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If however, in the ideal case, we expect all validators from the same committee to cast the exact same vote (same source, target and head), why bother collating all these votes as single `Attestation`s?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we set the bits of the `aggregation_bits` attribute to represent which validators from the committee have cast this exact attestation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = Attestation(AttestationData(source, target, head, committee, slot))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Possible values\n",
    "a.aggregation_bits = [0, 1] # val. 1 cast attestation a\n",
    "a.aggregation_bits = [1, 0] # val. 0 cast attestation a\n",
    "a.aggregation_bits = [1, 1] # vals. 0 and 1 cast attestation a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In [eth2's specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#attestation-aggregation), each slot, some validators are randomly chosen as aggregators. Their job is to collect a bunch of attestations from diverse validators and package them in unique attestations, with `aggregation_bits` fields set to denote which validators have attested to a particular vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the best case, if all validators of a committee have attested to the same vote, an aggregator will take in their big pile of attestations and output a single one with all bits set to 1. _How can they do that? Why wouldn't they set the bits to anything they want?_ This is the magic of BLS signatures, and the particular case of BLS12-381, an especially friendly elliptic curve that allows us to aggregate signatures securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat here is that while signatures are aggregatable, aggregates themselves are not! This means that we couldn't reduce further two aggregates of the same attestation with the following bits: `[0, 1, 1]` and `[1, 1, 0]`. In both aggregates, the second bit is set to 1, meaning that both aggregates have seen the attestation produced by the second validator. Aren't we double-counting then?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not! The beacon chain is quite permissive and the second validator would just see their vote included twice: once in the aggregate with bits `[0, 1, 1]`, and once in the aggregate with bits `[1, 1, 0]`. Validators are rewarded for their timeliness, or how fast their attestations are included in the chain. In case a validator's vote is included twice or more, the reward measures how fast their first inclusion was made and only counts that vote. Good guy beacon state!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulation, we follow more or less the same pattern but we do not model the behaviour of aggregators (yet!) Validators produce attestations on their own, setting the aggregate bit to 1 for themselves only. Once the block producer has collected all the attestations that were not included in their version of the chain (remember that we have two partitions!), they aggregate them as much as possible. This is done with the following two pieces of code:"

In this piece, we assumed no latency within each partition, so that validators in the same partition are always synced with each other. We'll relax this assumption and simulate how conflicts are resolved when block producers either do not release their blocks on time or experience delays communicating their blocks to other validators."
