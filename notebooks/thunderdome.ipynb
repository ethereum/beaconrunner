    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We really care (and want to check) that honest, protocol-following validators, reap the highest (in-protocol) rewards. We'll get a feel for what this means here by pitting different validator behaviours against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce a bit of terminology, we are creating an _agent-based model_ here. We do not explicitly code a scenario that agents follow, but program simple update and interaction rules, let them unfold for a while, and then look at the tape to infer conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll distinguish between _strategies_ and _behaviours_. A validator can do several things: attest, propose, or do nothing. We'll call _strategies_ instantiations of these particular actions. For instance, a validator may employ the strategy of always attesting correctly, or flipping a coin and half the time attesting correctly, half the time not attesting at all (a pretty dumb strategy if you ask me).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word _behaviour_ to describe the general articulation of these strategies: what to play and _when_. We explored in the [main notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2050/br2050.ipynb) the behaviour of the [ASAP validator](https://github.com/barnabemonnot/beaconrunner/blob/master/beaconrunner/validators/ASAPValidator.py), who does something as early as possible according to the specs (at the beginning of the slot for a block proposal; a third of a slot, i.e., 4 seconds in _or_ whenever the block for that slot is received for an attestation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at a different behaviour too: the [Prudent validator](https://github.com/barnabemonnot/beaconrunner/blob/master/beaconrunner/validators/PrudentValidator.py). Although validators are expected to propose their block as early as possible, network delays could prevent attesters from receiving the block before a third of the slot has elapsed. ASAP validators would attest anyways, at the risk of voting on the wrong head, before receiving the block for that slot. Prudent validators hedge their bets a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Prudent validators receive the block for their attesting slot, they publish their attestation with the head set to that block.\n",
    "- If more than 8 seconds have elapsed into the slot, and they still haven't received a block, they attest for the head they know about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, although prudent validators are willing to wait to see if the block will turn up, there is a limit to how long they will wait: they need to communicate their attestations in a timely manner after all! They only differ from ASAPs by how long they are willing to wait."

    "### Rewards under consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this behaviour impacts the payoff received by ASAP and prudent validators, let's dive into the rewards and penalties schedule for attesters (we won't look at rewards from block proposing here). Note first the following two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validators receive a bonus for attesting on the correct head. Attesting too early means possibly losing out on this bonus if the head specified in the attestation is incorrect.\n",
    "- Validators receive a bonus for early inclusion of their attestation in a block. This means that they should attest relatively soon, and cannot wait forever to see if a missing block will turn up.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see [here in the specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#get_attestation_deltas) how rewards and penalties are computed at the end of each epoch. Let's unpack the computations below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attester rewards in eth2\n",
    "\n",
    "A _base reward_ $\\texttt{BR}$ is computed that depends only on the validator's effective balance (maximum 32 ETH) and the current total active balance (the total effective balance of _all_ active validators). Letting $i$ denote our validator,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\texttt{BR[i]} = \\texttt{balance[i]} \\cdot \\frac{\\texttt{BRF}}{\\sqrt{\\texttt{total\\_balance}} \\cdot \\texttt{BRPE}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\texttt{BRPE}$ stands for _base rewards per epoch_. A validator can be rewarded for\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attesting to the correct source, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "2. Attesting to the correct target, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "3. Attesting to the correct head, yielding $\\texttt{BR[i]}$.\n",
    "4. Early inclusion, yielding at most $\\texttt{BR[i]} \\Big( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\texttt{PRQ}} \\Big)$ with $\\texttt{PRQ}$ the _proposer reward quotient_.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four items are why $\\texttt{BRPE}$ is set to 4 (at least in phase 0). $\\texttt{BRF}$, the _base reward factor_, is a scaling constant currently set at $2^6 = 64$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the first three items, we scale the base reward by the fraction of the active stake who correctly attested for the item. If $\\rho_s$ is the fraction of the stake who attested correctly for the source, then a validator $i$ with a correct source receives $\\rho_s \\cdot \\texttt{BR[i]}$. However, failure to attest or attesting for an incorrect source, target or head incurs the full $\\texttt{BR[i]}$ as penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dig deeper into item 4, early inclusion. Attestations may be included at least one slot after the slot they are attesting for, called the _committee slot_. If they are included in the block immediately following their committee slot, they receive the full base reward, minus the _proposer reward_, endowed to the block producer (see table below). If they are included in the block two slots after their committee slot, they receive half. Three blocks later, a third, etc. Attestations must be included at the latest one full epoch after their committee slot. This means the smallest inclusion reward is 1/32 of the base reward (assuming `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` is equal to 32).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the attester rewards in the best of times. Note however, that the penalties are not symmetric. Whenever a validator fails to attest for one of the first three items, or attests incorrectly, the penalty is equal to the whole base reward. No discount!\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the worst of times? From the perspective of rewards and penalities, this happens when the chain is not finalising epochs anymore (a situation we explored in a [different notebook](https://github.com/ethereum/rig/blob/master/eth2economics/code/beaconrunner2049/beacon_runner_2049.ipynb)). In this case, we want to \"leak\" the stake of inactive validators, who are preventing finalisation. A [recent modification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1830) ensures that validators who perform optimally (i.e., attest correctly to all three items _and_ included in the block immediately following their committee slot) do not suffer any losses. Meanwhile, validators who are not attesting for the correct target (a key ingredient for finalisation) suffer increasingly painful consequences, as the _finality delay_ (the gap between the current epoch and the last finalised epoch) grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all synthesised in the following table. \"IL\" items refer to \"Inactivity Leak\": the rewards and penalties during these worst of times."

    "### Some hypotheses before simulating\n",
    "\n",
    "In a network with perfect (or close to perfect) latency and honest proposers, we don't expect ASAP and prudent validator earnings to differ significantly. But under real-world conditions, the behaviour of prudent validators appears more _robust_ than that of ASAP validators. By robust, we mean that prudent validators perform better under slight variations of the parameters, e.g., the average network latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "When network delays are high or block proposers are lazy (meaning they don't propagate their blocks in time, perhaps because they are being prudent in order to collect more incoming attestations), prudent validators stand to reap the \"correct head\" reward more often. On the other hand, when network delays are really, really high, perhaps proposing ASAP is a better strategy, as it ensures at least _something_ goes through, even if it's possibly incorrect.\n",
